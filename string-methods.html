<body>
    <p>1.chatAt: it will take index as argument and gives the character at the passed index</p>
    <p>2.indexOf: it will accept charcter as arugument and gives the first index of the specific character that we
        passed</p>
    <p>3.lastIndexOf: it will accept charcter as arugument and gives the last index of the specific character that we
        passed</p>
    <p>4.concat: it will concatenate 2 or more strings into one </p>
    <p>5.length : it will give length of the string</p>
    <p>6.toUpperCase: it will convert all characters in string into uppercase</p>
    <p>7.toLowerrCase: it will convert all characters in string into lowercase</p>
    <p>8.trim: it will remove the trailing spaces from starting of the string</p>
    <p>9.split: it will each charcater into array with spaces it can split or without spaces also it can split and it
        will accept one optional parameter if we pass that character it will split based on that character</p>
    <p>10.starts with: it can filter the string with charater of string that we given check from starting and it will
        return boolean value</p>
    <p>11.ends with: it can filter the string with charater of string that we given check from ending and it will
        return boolean value</p>
    <p>12.slice: it will give the piece of string that from starting index and excludes ending index it will support
        negative indexing as well</p>
    <p>13.substring: it will give the piece of string that from starting index and excludes ending index it won't
        support negative indexing</p>
    <p>14.substr: it will accept 2 paramters and one is start index and otherone is count from start index it will give
        the slice of the string based on the length we passed from start index</p>
    <p>15.includes: it will check the string exist or not and it will return boolean value</p>
    <p>16.charCodeAt: it will give the ascii value of the index of the character the we pass</p>
